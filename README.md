# yamaze: A Maze Generator
Bart Massey 2021

Features of this maze generator.

* Can take an arbitrary cell membership ("clipping
  function") and generate a perfect maze using that (with
  limits).

* Generates a PNG (currently hardwired to `test.png`).

* Dimension adjustable to quite large while still fast.

Currently hardwired to produce a toroidal maze. Entrance
and exit must be chozen manually.
